# targz.js

This script provides a facility for downloading and reading .tar.gz files in Web browser JavaScript environments.

Originally taken from [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/kig/417483) by @kig, who in turn copy-pasted together the bulk of it from different samples online.

Projects in a Node/Browserify environment may wish to consider the [node-tar.gz](https://github.com/alanhoff/node-tar.gz) library instead
