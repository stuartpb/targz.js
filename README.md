# targz.js

This script provides a facility for downloading and reading .tar.gz files in Web browser JavaScript environments.

Originally taken from [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/kig/417483) by @kig, who built it by augmenting his .tar parser ["with the power of copy-pasting code from the INTERNET"](http://fhtr.blogspot.com/2010/05/loading-targz-with-javascript.html).

Projects in a Node/Browserify environment may wish to consider the [node-tar.gz](https://github.com/alanhoff/node-tar.gz) library instead
